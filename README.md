# High-frequency-volatility-and-market-microstructure

This exploratory study begins with the implementation of Almgren & Chriss's seminal model from their research paper "Optimal Execution of Portfolio Transactions," a foundational work in price impact models. The primary goal is to understand the model's relevance to high-frequency trading. The study also investigates the effects of different trading benchmarks—such as implementation shortfall, VWAP, and TWAP—on trading trajectories and the efficient frontier, and explores the impact of various volatility estimators by implementing some of these within the framework.
